## Color Schemes for MATE terminal

Color Schemes For Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS and all distributions using MATE terminal, colors are based on the Gogh project (you can check some themes [here...](https://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh/)).

![elementary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mayccoll/Gogh/master/images/demos/themes.gif)

In this repos, you'll find all the themes from the Gogh project already converted to work and install with MATE desktop environment.

##### NOTES:
- I'll try to update this repo with new themes included in Gogh, please let me know if you're missing a theme or want me to include new ones.
- I've added a new theme based on Monokai-soda, it's a personal tweak which is called Monokai-soda_hatt.


## Requirements

- dconf (it should already be installed on all distributions I know with MATE, mentioned here for exhaustivity)

## Install

Change directory to the themes folder:

```bash
$ cd themes
```

Pick the theme you'd like to install, and simply launch its associated script.
Under is an example with 'Monokai-dark' theme:
```bash
$ ./monokai-dark.sh
```

Make sure you exit all your terminals before you open a new terminal, and voila!

No need for root, juggling with profiles or anything complicated! ;-) The theme will be installed for the default profile and you're good to go.


## Create your own theme
